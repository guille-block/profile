							<h2>Welcome! This is my personal portfolio. 
								Get to know me and check out some of my work.

						<p>I was born in Tandil, Argentina in 1996. At the age of 12 I traveled with my family to the city of San Diego, CA
							where we spent the next 3 months. I started attending La Joya middle School and there I got to live my first international experience. 
							It was a hard time, probably as hard as it would be for any 12 year old student who gets taken out of its comfort zone and 
							dragged to a completely new life.</p>

							<p class="learn-more" style="display: none;">After my experience in San Diego I went back to Argentina and started 
							my secondary studies. Once the school day finished, I used to spend entire afternoons playing golf.
						Since I was really young I had a great fascinations for sports. Even today I practice and watch many different sports
					but golf has been a sport that has impacted my life the most as It gave me friends and a lot of memories.</p>

							<p class="learn-more" style="display: none;">Around the age of 15, me and a couple of frineds started getting involved 
							in social activities. It was a really special time because we got to learn how even small things can 
						make an impact. With the sponsorship of our local Rotary club we founded <i>Interact Tandil Oeste</i>, a social acitvity group for young
								people. We took on a lot of projects covering different topics. Even today, long after we left, the group is still active and helping communities.</p>

							<p class="learn-more" style="display: none;">On my last year of high school I decided I needed a change and became an exchange student 
							in Rotary's youth international program. I got selected to spend my entire last year of high school in the city of Boise ID.
						Through my entire year I got to live incredible experiences and met a lot of interesting people. That year I spent there was really special as 
					I felt part of the community. One of my biggest accomplishments there was to play varsity golf and winning the district championship while graduating
				at the end of the year from a foreign high school as any normal US student</p>

							<p class="learn-more" style="display: none;">It was not easy deciding what to do with my future. I had the option of staying in the United States for college to play golf,
							but at the end I made up my mind and I came back to Argentina and decided I wanted to study Economics in <i>Universidad de San Andr√©s</i>. </p>
